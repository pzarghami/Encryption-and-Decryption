# Encryption-and-Decryption
This project is for the Advanced Programming (AP) course

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with standard input/output, working with files and vectors in C++ language. In this exercise, we implemented a simple stream encoder.
Stream encryption is used to encrypt a stream of characters in this project.

**Program input**
The program generally has 5 inputs. The first entry indicates the encryption or decryption of the file. The next entry shows its type. The third input is the decryption or encryption key. The fourth entry shows the address of the input file for encryption or decryption. And finally, the last entry shows the address of the output file after one of the encryption or decryption operations.
```
1 $ g++ -std=c++11 sarbaste.cpp
2 $ ./a.out
3 <encrypt/decrypt>
4 <simple/complicated>
5 <key>
6 <input file path>
7 <output file path>
```
 ###### for example:
 ```
1 $ ./a.out
2 encrypt
3 simple
4 PASSWORD
5 ./input.txt
6 ./output.txt
```
